<strong>Technologies Used for the project</strong>:

<br>
1.	<strong>HTML</strong>: Create the structure and layout of web pages, defining necessary elements such as forms, tables, and headings to capture and display budget-related data.
<br>
2.	CSS: Apply styles to HTML elements to enhance the visual appearance of the app and define colors, fonts, spacing, and other design aspects, ensuring a consistent and appealing user interface.
<br>
3.	<strong>JavaScript</strong>: Add interactivity to the app and handle user input, perform calculations, and update the interface dynamically. For example, validate form inputs, calculate budget totals, and provide real-time feedback to users.
<br>
4.	<strong>Python (with Flask)</strong>: Handle the backend logic of the app, managing different URLs and connecting them with corresponding Python functions. These functions can process form submissions, retrieve or store data in the database, perform calculations, and generate reports.
<br>
5.	<strong>API</strong>: API component is responsible for creating endpoints that handle requests and connect with the database. It plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between the frontend and backend, enabling functionalities such as data retrieval, manipulation, and validation for budget-related operations.
<br>
6.	<strong>MySQL</strong>: Utilize a database management system to store and retrieve budget-related data. Create database tables to store expenses, categories, and other relevant information. Use SQL queries in Python code to interact with the database, such as inserting new expense records, retrieving budget summaries, or generating reports based on specific criteria.
<br>
<h2>Future plans for the project:</h2>
<br>
1.	<strong>Bank Statement Integration</strong>: Connect the application with users' bank accounts to import transaction data automatically.
<br>
2.	<strong>Scan Bill Functionality</strong>: Implement the ability to scan bills or receipts for easy expense tracking.
<br>
3.	<strong>Data Encryption</strong>: Enhance security and privacy by implementing robust data encryption measures.
<br>
4.	<strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: Improve the application's performance to ensure fast and reliable operation, even as the user base and data volume grow.
